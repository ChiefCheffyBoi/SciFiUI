# SciFi UI Project

Fork this repository and use it a starter project for your assignment

# Description of the assignment
This assignment is a baisc space shuttle. When a button is clicked it either follows a certain commant eg. red alert
or it brings the user to the selected planet. Music releating to each planet will be played and some relevant information
about the planet will be displayed. 

# Instructions
It is very simple to use. Simply click a button and the action is carried out. 

# How it works
Each critical element to the UI has a different class.For example, each planet, the common background and the stars 
are all seperate classes.  

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
I am proud about the etire project. The late submission may suggest otherwise but I put a lot of time and thought into 
what I'd do and how I'd do it. There was a lot of trial and error. My favourite part is the aesthetic of the UI. I believe it's 
pretty in a plain but effective design.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
